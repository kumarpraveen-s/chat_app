# Chat Web App with JWT Authentication

This is a simple **Chat Web App** built using **React (JavaScript)** with **Vite** for the frontend and **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for authentication. The backend API is built with **Node.js** and **Express**, and it uses **JWT** to authenticate users and allow them to send/receive messages securely.

## Features

-   **JWT Authentication**: Secure login/signup using JSON Web Tokens.
-   **Real-time Chat**: Send and receive messages in real-time using **WebSockets** (e.g., `socket.io`).
-   **User Authentication**: Users can log in and authenticate via JWT, and their session is managed.
-   **Frontend**: Built with React and Vite for fast development and optimal build performance.
-   **Backend**: Node.js/Express with JWT for user authentication and socket communication.

-   **Database**:
    -   MongoDB (for storing user data and messages)
